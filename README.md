# Kindroid Fun Utility Scripts
ViolentMonkey Scripts I made to improve my experience using Kindroid.ai
**These scripts require the ViolentMonkey extension; It is available in the Chrome Web Store or the Firefox Addon Store.**

I use ViolentMonkey and Google Chrome to execute my scripts, but they should work anywhere ViolentMonkey or another similar userscript extension function correctly. Feel free to fork my scripts to make changes and improve them.

## How to Install
Below are the links to install every ViolentMonkey Script from this repo:
