# kindroidaiscripts
Scripts I made to improve my experience using Kindroid.ai

I use ViolentMonkey and Google Chrome to execute my scripts (unless stated otherwise). Download the scripts to use them or make them your own. The easiest way to add scripts to ViolentMonkey is just to copy and paste after clicking the plus on the TamperMonkey extension box.
